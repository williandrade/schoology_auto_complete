# Will's Auto Complete

A simple auto complete project

```agsl
Build a backend in a language such as: Node, or Node-typescript, Php, Python or Java to drive the data supplied to your auto complete. You own the shape of the API, as you will be using it in part 2, so do yourself a favor and make it pleasant. We are trying to leave some specifics open to some interpretation for you to show off your architectural design skills.

 

There are a few architectural requirements:

The service should contain at least one endpoint that can return data over http to a client. 
This will all run on a single machine, so https is not required
The API should accept at least a string to use as a search for the front-end.
 

Running this code:

Provide sufficient documentation such that a Schoology developer with docker can, if needed build, and run your application
Provide a curl command to execute your api
Notes:

Not all specialties will do both assignments as part of the interview process, please be sure to read the docs. Interviewing is time consuming, just do what you need.
